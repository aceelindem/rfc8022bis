      <t>This document contains a specification of three YANG modules
      and one submodule. Together they form the core routing data
      model that serves as a framework for configuring and managing a
      routing subsystem. It is expected that these modules will be
      augmented by additional YANG modules defining data models for
      control-plane protocols, route filters, and other functions. The core
      routing data model provides common building blocks for such
      extensions -- routes, Routing Information Bases (RIBs), and
      control-plane protocols.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>This document contains a specification of the following YANG
      modules:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The "ietf-routing" module provides generic components of a
        routing data model.</t>
        <t>The "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" module augments the
        "ietf-routing" module with additional data specific to IPv4
        unicast.</t>
        <t>The "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module augments the
        "ietf-routing" module with additional data specific to IPv6
        unicast. Its submodule "ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements" also
        augments the "ietf-interfaces"&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7223"/> and
        "ietf-ip"&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7277"/> modules with IPv6 router
        configuration variables required by <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>These modules together define the so-called core routing data
      model, which is intended as a basis for future data model
      development covering more-sophisticated routing systems. While
      these three modules can be directly used for simple IP devices
      with static routing (see <xref target="app.minimum"/>), their
      main purpose is to provide essential building blocks for more-complicated data models involving multiple control-plane protocols,
      multicast routing, additional address families, and advanced
      functions such as route filtering or policy routing. 


To this
      end, it is expected that the core routing data model will be
      augmented by numerous modules developed by various IETF working
      groups.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.objectives" title="Objectives">
      <t>The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by
      the following objectives:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The data model should be suitable for the common address
        families -- in particular, IPv4 and IPv6 -- and for unicast and
        multicast routing, as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching
        (MPLS).</t>
        <t>A simple IP routing system, such as one that uses only
        static routing, should be configurable in a simple way,
        ideally without any need to develop additional YANG
        modules.</t>
        <t>On the other hand, the core routing framework must allow
        for complicated implementations involving multiple Routing
        Information Bases (RIBs) and multiple control-plane protocols, as
        well as controlled redistributions of routing information.</t>
        <t>
Because device vendors will want to map the data models built on this
    generic framework to their proprietary data models and
    configuration interfaces, the framework should be
    flexible enough to facilitate that and accommodate data
    models with different logic.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.design" title="The Design of the Core Routing Data Model">

      <t>The core routing data model consists of three YANG modules
      and one submodule. The first module, "ietf-routing", defines the
      generic components of a routing system. The other two modules,
      "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing",
      augment the "ietf-routing" module with additional data nodes
      that are needed for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast routing,
      respectively. The "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module has a
      submodule, "ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements", that augments the
      "ietf-interfaces"&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7223"/> and "ietf-ip"&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7277"/> modules with configuration variables for IPv6
      router advertisements as required by <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Figures <xref target="fig.confdata" format="counter"/> and&nbsp;<xref target="fig.statedata" format="counter"/> show abridged views of the configuration and
      state data hierarchies. See <xref target="app.data-tree"/> for
      the complete data trees.</t>

      <t>As can be seen from Figures <xref target="fig.confdata" format="counter"/> and&nbsp;<xref target="fig.statedata" format="counter"/>, the core routing data model introduces
      several generic components of a routing framework: routes, RIBs
      containing lists of routes, and control-plane protocols. <xref target="sec.building-blocks"/> describes these components in
      more detail.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.system-user" title="System-Controlled and User-Controlled List Entries">
        <t>The core routing data model defines several lists in the
        schema tree, such as "rib", that have to be populated with at
        least one entry in any properly functioning device, and
        additional entries may be configured by a client.</t>
        <t>In such a list, the server creates the required item as a
        so-called system-controlled entry in state data, i.e., inside
        the "routing-state" container.</t>
        <t>An example can be seen in <xref target="app.get-reply"/>: the
        "/routing-state/ribs/rib" list has two
        system-controlled entries named "ipv4-master" and
        "ipv6-master".</t>
        <t>Additional entries may be created in the configuration by
        a client, e.g., via the NETCONF protocol. These are so-called
        user-controlled entries. If the server accepts a configured
        user-controlled entry, then this entry also appears in the
        state data version of the list.</t>
        <t>Corresponding entries in both versions of the list (in
        state data and configuration) have the same value of the list
        key.</t>
        <t>A client may also provide supplemental configuration of
        system-controlled entries. To do so, the client creates a new
        entry in the configuration with the desired contents. In order
        to bind this entry to the corresponding entry in the state
        data list, the key of the configuration entry has to be set to
        the same value as the key of the state entry.</t>
        <t>Deleting a user-controlled entry from the configuration list
        results in the removal of the corresponding entry in the
        state data list. In contrast, if a system-controlled
        entry is deleted from the configuration list, only the extra
        configuration specified in that entry is removed but the
        corresponding state data entry remains in the list.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.building-blocks" title="Basic Building Blocks">

      <t>This section describes the essential components of the core
      routing data model.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.route" title="Route">
        <t>Routes are basic elements of information in a routing
        system. The core routing data model defines only the following
        minimal set of route attributes:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>"destination-prefix": address prefix specifying the set
          of destination addresses for which the route may be
          used. This attribute is mandatory.</t>
          <t>"route-preference": an integer value (also known as
          administrative distance) that is used for selecting a
          preferred route among routes with the same destination
          prefix. A lower value means a more preferred route.</t>


          <t>"next-hop": determines the outgoing interface and/or
          next-hop address(es), or a special operation to be performed with a
          packet.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>Routes are primarily state data that appear as entries of
        RIBs (<xref target="sec.rib"/>) but they may also be found in
        configuration data, for example, as manually configured static
        routes. In the latter case, configurable route attributes are
        generally a subset of attributes defined for RIB routes.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.rib" title="Routing Information Base (RIB)">
        <t>Every implementation of the core routing data model manages
        one or more Routing Information Bases (RIBs). A RIB is a list
        of routes complemented with administrative data. Each RIB
        contains only routes of one address family. An address family
        is represented by an identity derived from the
        "rt:address-family" base identity.</t>
        <t>In the core routing data model, RIBs are state data
        represented as entries of the list
        "/routing-state/ribs/rib". The contents of
        RIBs are controlled and manipulated by control-plane protocol
        operations that may result in route additions, removals, and
        modifications. This also includes manipulations via the
        "static" and/or "direct" pseudo-protocols; see <xref target="sec.pseudoproto"/>.</t>

        <t>For every supported address family, exactly one RIB MUST be
        marked as the so-called default RIB to which control-plane
	protocols place their routes by default.</t>

        <t>Simple router implementations that do not advertise the
        feature "multiple-ribs" will typically create one
        system-controlled RIB per supported address family and mark
        it as the default RIB.</t>

        <t>More-complex router implementations advertising the
        "multiple-ribs" feature support multiple RIBs per address
        family that can be used for policy routing and other
        purposes.</t>

        <t>The following action (see Section&nbsp;7.15 of <xref target="RFC7950"/>) is defined for the "rib" list:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>active-route -- return the active RIB route for the
          destination address that is specified as the action's input
          parameter.</t>
        </list></t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.proto" title="Control-Plane Protocol">

        <t>The core routing data model provides an open-ended
        framework for defining multiple control-plane protocol
        instances, e.g., for Layer 3 routing protocols. Each control-plane protocol instance MUST be assigned a type, which is an
        identity derived from the "rt:control&nbhy;plane-protocol" base
        identity. The core routing data model defines two identities
        for the direct and static pseudo-protocols (<xref target="sec.pseudoproto"/>).</t>
        <t>Multiple control-plane protocol instances of the same type MAY be
        configured.</t>

        <section anchor="sec.pseudoproto" title="Routing Pseudo-Protocols">

          <t>The core routing data model defines two special routing
          protocol types -- "direct" and "static". Both are in fact
          pseudo-protocols, which means that they are confined to the
          local device and do not exchange any routing information
          with adjacent routers.</t>
          <t>Every implementation of the core routing data model MUST
          provide exactly one instance of the "direct" pseudo-protocol
          type. It is the source of direct routes for all configured
          address families. Direct routes are normally supplied by the
          operating system kernel, based on the configuration of
          network interface addresses; see <xref target="sec.ietf-ip"/>.</t>
          <t>A pseudo-protocol of the type "static" allows for specifying
          routes manually. It MAY be configured in zero or multiple
          instances, although a typical configuration will have exactly
          one instance.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="sec.newproto" title="Defining New Control-Plane Protocols">
          <t>It is expected that future YANG modules will create data
          models for additional control-plane protocol types. Such a new
          module has to define the protocol-specific configuration and
          state data, and it has to integrate it into the core routing
          framework in the following way:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>A new identity MUST be defined for the control-plane protocol,
            and its base identity MUST be set to "rt:control-plane-protocol"
            or to an identity derived from "rt:control&nbhy;plane-protocol".</t>
            <t>Additional route attributes MAY be defined, preferably in
            one place by means of defining a YANG grouping. The new
            attributes have to be inserted by augmenting the definitions
            of the nodes

            actions or RPC operations.</t>
            <t>Configuration parameters and/or state data for the new

          <t>By using a "when" statement, the augmented configuration

          <t>The original specification <xref target="RFC4861"/>
          allows the implementations to decide whether the
          "valid-lifetime" and "preferred-lifetime" parameters remain
          the same in consecutive advertisements or decrement in real
          time. However, the latter behavior seems problematic because
          the values might be reset again to the (higher) configured
          values after a configuration is reloaded. Moreover, no
          implementation is known to use the decrementing
          behavior. The "ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements" submodule
          therefore stipulates the former behavior with constant

      <t>Configuration and state data conforming to the core routing
      data model (defined in this document) are designed to be
      accessed via a management protocol with a secure transport layer,
      such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>. The NETCONF access
      control model <xref target="RFC6536"/> provides the means to
      restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured
      subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and
      content.</t>
      <t>A number of configuration data nodes defined in the YANG
      modules belonging to the core routing data model are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true" in YANG terms,
      which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
      operations to these data nodes, such as "edit-config" in
      NETCONF, can have negative effects on the network if the
      protocol operations are not properly protected.</t>
      <t>The vulnerable "config true" parameters and subtrees are the
      following:
      <list style="hanging">

        <t hangText="/routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol:">This
        list specifies the control-plane protocols configured on a

        <t hangText="/routing/ribs/rib:">This list
        specifies the RIBs configured for the device.</t>
      </list>

      Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
      routing subsystem of both the local device and the network. This
      may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets to
      inappropriate destinations, and other problems.</t>

    <section anchor="app.minimum" title="Minimum Implementation">

      <t>Some parts and options of the core routing model, such as
      user-defined RIBs, are intended only for advanced routers. This
      appendix gives basic non-normative guidelines for implementing a
      bare minimum of available functions. Such an implementation may
      be used for hosts or very simple routers.</t>
      <t>A minimum implementation does not support the feature
      "multiple&nbhy;ribs". This means that a single system-controlled RIB
      is available for each supported address family -- IPv4, IPv6, or
      both. These RIBs are also the default RIBs. No user-controlled
      RIBs are allowed.</t>
      <t>In addition to the mandatory instance of the "direct"
      pseudo-protocol, a minimum implementation should support
      configuring instance(s) of the "static" pseudo-protocol.</t>
      <t>For hosts that are never intended to act as routers, the
      ability to turn on sending IPv6 router advertisements (<xref target="sec.4861"/>) should be removed.</t>
      <t>Platforms with severely constrained resources may use
      deviations for restricting the data model, e.g., limiting the
      number of "static" control-plane protocol instances.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="app.rip" title="Example: Adding a New Control-Plane Protocol">

      <t>This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model
      can be extended to support a new control-plane protocol. The YANG
      module "example-rip" shown below is intended as an illustration
      rather than a real definition of a data model for the Routing
      Information Protocol (RIP). For the sake of brevity, this module does not
      obey all the guidelines specified in <xref target="RFC6087"/>. See also <xref target="sec.newproto"/>.</t>
